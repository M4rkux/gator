We're going to build an RSS feed aggregator in Go! We'll call it "Gator", you know, because aggreGATOR 🐊. Anyhow, it's a CLI tool that allows users to:

- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post
